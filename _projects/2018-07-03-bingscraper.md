description:
summary: ﻿﻿﻿﻿The bingscraper is python3 package which extracts the text and images content on Bing (the search engine:- bing.com). The script working in background requests for a search term and creates directory (if not made previously) in the root directory of the script where all the content of the related particular search is stored. This script will be downloading the hypertext and hyperlink to that text and saving it to a .txt file within the directory made by itself. This directory saves the text content as well as the images downloaded using the script.

_dummy-text_: on of level 1, 2 & 3 features from a high resolution fingerprint image. The recognition system calculates the cosine similarity score between the two representations to generate a distribution of scores (genuine and imposter score distributions) and hence, plot a probability $$p$$ vs matching score $$s$$ graph to study the tradeoff between false match rate (FMR) and false non-match rate (FNMR). The implementation of the deep learning architecture for this recognition system is done using PyTorch framework.
