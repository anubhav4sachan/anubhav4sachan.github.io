title: The Paperless
description:
summary: PaperLess, an automation PWA, is responsible for auto-filling the required form and forwarding the filled application form to various concerned authorities. The only manual thing in PaperLess is selection of form by the student. After the selection of form, everything is automated including forwarding the application to the concerned authorities. At the end of the process, PaperLess produces the final approved application.

A customized deep learning based fingerprint recognition system has been developed using the multitask deep convolutional neural network architecture to extract the fixed length representation of level 1, 2 & 3 features from a high resolution fingerprint image. The recognition system calculates the cosine similarity score between the two representations to generate a distribution of scores (genuine and imposter score distributions) and hence, plot a probability $$p$$ vs matching score $$s$$ graph to study the tradeoff between false match rate (FMR) and false non-match rate (FNMR). The implementation of the deep learning architecture for this recognition system is done using PyTorch framework.
