title: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Fingerprint Recognition

The deep learning architectures perform remarkably when trained with enormous amount of labelled data (supervised learning). In absence of labelled data, the domain adaptation provides an enticing alternative for the data of similar nature but from a different domain. The adaptation behaviour in the DeepResPore Architecture has been achieved by augmenting it with few standard layers and a new Gradient Reversal Layer. The resulting augmented architecture has been trained using backpropagation using the Adam optimizing algorithm.
