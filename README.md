# GitHub Portfolio Page.

`anubhav4sachan.github.io` or [anubhavsachan.com](https://anubhavsachan.com) is a web designing side project developed as the portfolio for constant updation and additions of records that reflect accomplishments, skills, experiences and attributes in connection with me.

This portfolio page has most recent noticable developments in the academic, development, and extra-curricular life. 

### Current Version

The current version is built on `Jekyll` because of its increasing popularity (huge credit to Markdown) and easy inclusion of the blog.

#### Previous Version(s)
There exists an older version as well in the `master` branch which is made in single `HTML5` file and it uses `CSS3`, `JavaScripts (jQuery, validator, owl)`, `BootStrap v3.3.5`, `FontAwesome Icons` and `GitHub` to enhance the front end design of the web page. The backend technology used is `php` because of the fact that there is only a single contact form which does not require a lot of data processing.
