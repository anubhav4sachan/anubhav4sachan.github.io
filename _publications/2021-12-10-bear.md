title: BEAR:&nbsp;Reinforcement Learning for Throughput Aware Borrowing in Energy Harvesting Systems
description: gt
summary: Energy Borrowing (EB) aided Energy harvesting (EH) systems provide a greener alternative to self-sustaining electronic devices in a complex, unprecedented environment by borrowing energy from a supplementary source to regulate the data transmission flow. We propose a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for energy scheduling policy which jointly optimizes the EB and utilizes harvested energy for efficient data transfer at every time instant. As the exact pattern of harvested energy and channel conditions at any time slot is unknown, the proposed algorithm, BEAR (_Borrowing Energy with Adaptive Rewards_), based on actor-critic architecture, learns the optimal power allocation policy for the transmission node. Our designed reward function accommodates the concept of adaptive penalty to punish the transmission node for selecting unfavourable actions. Our simulations show that the BEAR algorithm providing efficient energy management with a focus on throughput maximization yields a 35.45% enhancement in sum throughput over a typical non-borrowing system. Lastly, nontrivial design insights are outlined via numerical results to quantify the practical efficacy of BEAR for EH systems.
