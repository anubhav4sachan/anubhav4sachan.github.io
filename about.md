June has been an eventful month.<br>
&ensp; I've graduated with my bachelor's degree (B. Tech.) from the Department of <a href = "http://www.nits.ac.in/departments/ece/ece.php" target="_blank">Electronics and Communication Engineering</a> at the <a href = "hhttp://www.nits.ac.in/" target="_blank">National Institute of Technology Silchar</a>.<br>&ensp; I worked with <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1AleAUIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Deepak Mishra</a> (<a href = "https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-deepak-mishra" target="_blank">University of New South Wales, Sydney</a>) and <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lHbOWx0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Ganesh Prasad</a> (<a href = "https://www.nits.ac.in" target="_blank">National Institute of Technology Silchar</a>) for my <i>bachelor's thesis</i>.<br>
&ensp; I have also completed my *Spring Research Internship* at <a href = "https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/" target="_blank">NVIDIA Corporation</a> on deep learning inference using NVIDIA SDKs (<a href = "https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt/" target="_blank">TensorRT</a>, <a href = "https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server" target="_blank">Triton Inference Server</a> and <a href = "https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk" target="_blank">DeepStream</a>).

In April, I served as Module Head for Cyberwarp at <a href = "https://www.tecnoesis.org" target="_blank">Tecnoesis '21</a>.



### 2020

I'm associated with Green Communications Systems Lab under <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lHbOWx0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Ganesh Prasad</a> and working in the Machine Learning domain.

Parallely, I've also started interning with <a href = "https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/" target="_blank"> NVIDIA Corporation</a>, Bangalore, in Deep Learning Inference using CUDA Parallel Programming.

During April - June, I have worked with Speech and Language Technology Lab at <a href = "https://saarthi.ai" target="_blank">Saarthi.ai</a>, a conversational AI startup, as Deep Learning Research Intern to improve the dialogue agent policy using Actor-Critic framework and focusing on dialogue generation through few-shot knowledge transfer networks. Major topics of study were Reinforcement Learning, Dialogue Policy Learning, ML Interpretability & Natural Language Processing.

I had voluntarily worked, as the Event Head, Data Strata and Publicity Co-Head for <a href = "https://www.tecnoesis.org" target="_blank">Tecnoesis '20</a> (NITS' Techno-management fest) till February.


### 2019

Since, September till November, I had been heading various teams in different fests organized as the courtesy of NITS Gymkhana. These were basically Web Development Head at SPIC MACAY, Technical Head at All India Inter NIT Tournament & Technical Team in Srijan 1.0. 

Late August, I had emerged as the Winner of the Hackathon Module at NIT Conclave in NIT Rourkela amongst 31 NITs for the app, The PaperLess.

During May - July, I had an enriching experience of working in Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis Lab at <a href = "https://www.iiti.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Indore</a> with <a href = "http://www.iiti.ac.in/people/~kvivek/" target="_blank">Dr. Vivek Kanhangad</a>, where we developed a Pore based Fingerprint Recognition System built on residual based Convolutional Neural Network Architecture and its Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation using a gradient reversal layer. 

In February, our team was selected to represent NIT Silchar in the national level final of <a href = "https://www.sih.gov.in/" target="_blank">Smart India Hackathon (Software Edition) 2020</a> organized by Ministry of Human Resources and Development, Government of India.


### 2018

I also have worked with Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Lab at <a href = "http://www.mnnit.ac.in/" target="_blank">Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad</a> with <a href = "https://dksinghmnnit.github.io" target="_blank">Dr. Dushyant Kumar Singh</a> to explore various basic machine learning algorithms and to employ challenge of ICDAR to predict the gender of a handwritten document during Winter of 2018.
